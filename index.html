    <hr />
    <p>I have two kids they are 16 and 12.</p>
    <br />  
    <p>It has been my dream to be a programmer for about 4 years now.  
        One of my friends is a successful Solutions Manger/Architect.  
        I had always had an interest but lacked the confidence. 
        He helped me build on my web development skills (from 20 years ago) and started mentoring me in software development.  
        BUT suddenly our mentorship was halted and I had to put it to the side while I filled my time with surviving life.  
        This created a deep desire for a more fulfilling career with a path of success.  
        I am very excited to finally complete this part of the journey and complete the learning I started 4 years ago! </p>
